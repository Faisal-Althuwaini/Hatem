## Installation

### Environment Variables

A `.env` file should be placed inside the `Hatem-backend/` directory to store the OpenAI API key. The file should contain:

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Hatem-backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the FastAPI server (which includes the RAG implementation):
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Hatem-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, open the frontend in your browser and interact with Hatem.
